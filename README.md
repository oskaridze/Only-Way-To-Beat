Only Way To Beat - a rhythm game in which you will have to mercilessly cut flying monsters with your katana to the musical beat.

Imagine, you appear high in the sky and some monster rains down on you, and you start to furiously run after it, cutting down everyone in your path, and doing this all to the cheerful rhythm of music.

But remember, after every miss you age a year, and it becomes more difficult to keep up with the music.
